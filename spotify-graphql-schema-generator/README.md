# spotify-graphql-schema-generator

A GraphQL schema generator to generate the GraphQL schema used by the [spotify-graphql-server](../spotify-graphql-server/README.md). The generator uses the Spotify's Open Api definition with the fixes from my [spotify-web-api](https://github.com/sonallux/spotify-web-api) project.
